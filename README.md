A kingdom builder habit tracker

This is essential a habit tracker and to-do list program that I made to make tracking things more fun.

It has you create a kingdom and your to-do list and completed habits effect the ruler and kingdom.

Each day you log in you get a new event that has happened in the kingdom that year.

After 3 days of continuous logging in you can get a bonus building that can reduce or remove negative events
or can make good events even better.

Overall I think the program is kinda fun to use and I hope you enjoy using it.
